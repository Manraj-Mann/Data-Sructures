# Data-Sructures & Algorithms

Data structure is a particular way of storing and
organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. A data structure is a special
format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include arrays, files, linked
lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.
Depending on the organization of the elements, data structures are classified into two types:

1) Linear data structures: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not
compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks and
Queues.

2) Non â€“ linear data structures: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a
non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs. 

This repository is contatining all the data structures available in detail as per book DSA made easy.

# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. A linked list has the following
properties.Successive elements are connected by pointers , last element points to NULL , can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program , can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts) and does not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers). It
allocates memory as list grows.

# Stacks

Definition: A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called
top. The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called the Last in First out
(LIFO) or First in Last out (FILO) list.

# Queues

A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end (rear) and
deletions are done at other end (front). The first element to be inserted is the first one to be
deleted. Hence, it is called First in First out (FIFO) or Last in Last out (LILO) list.
